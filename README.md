# Simple AFK Timer and Stopwatch Extension
 Hey all, here's my very simple Timer and Stopwatch Extension that forces the user to get away from their laptop.

Here's the basic idea I had for this extension and it's use cases.
At the surface level, it may seem like a simple, bland timer and stopwatch extension. However, in actuality, it is an extension meant to force the user to focus on work outside of their computer.

The AFK part of the name doesn't mean that the extension works in the background. Nope. It means that you are meant to use it when you will complete work outside of your computer. This is a restriction imposed upon everyone who uses the extension since it stops working if you click out of it. This is intentional so people who need to spend time away from their laptop are incentivized to do so.

For Example:
The Stopwatch shows them how much time they've spent away from their device; seeing the numbers increase in the stopwatch as they are proud to be the reason.
The Timer - well it's a countdown really - is designed to motivate people to do work. Just X more minutes till the timer rings and I can stop. Except, in reality, the timer doesn't make any noise when it's done. It counts down to 0 and stops. This is intentional. While it's hard to start, once a person starts doing work, it isn't hard to continue. It is similar to Newton's 1st Law of Motion. An object in motion, stays in motion, unless acted upon by an external force. Likewise, a person who's working, will work, till the alarm bell rings and disrupts his flow.
Both of these, the timer and the stopwatch, were specifically designed for me so that I could make myself read my school textbooks. (Coding is more fun.)

Also, I've gone for the plain bland design so people wouldn't be preoccupied with figuring out everything. Nope. By keeping it plain and simple, I reduce such distractions.
